Hi! I'm a former banking and finance professional who has always had a passion for cool tech. I have an economics background and, after completing an MBA, spent 8+ years helping companies communicate their investment case in a clear and compelling way, however in 2022 my love for computing and coding led me to finally take the plunge and pursure new challenges in tech. Now, what was previously an obsessive hobby has become my full-time focus, which is really exciting!
